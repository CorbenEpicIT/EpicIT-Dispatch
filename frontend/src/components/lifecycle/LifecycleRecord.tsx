/**
 * What happened to this document.
 *
 * A resolved dispute used to disappear the moment it was resolved — the banner
 * rendered only while Open — leaving the outcome, the note, both actors and the
 * document the resolution produced stored and shown nowhere. The replacement
 * reached ChangeHistory as a bare UUID under a humanized key.
 *
 * Revision lineage used to live here too, as a row of ±1 chips. It moved to
 * DocumentLineage, above the fold: a dispatcher asking "is this the version
 * that counts" should not have to open the Activity tab to find out.
 *
 * It went with the `kind` prop, which those chips were the only reader of:
 * the one link left here routes by the kind of document the RESOLUTION
 * produced, which a dispute names itself.
