 * became `numeric(10,2)` these fields were `Int`, so the old `number` signature was
 * safe; the moment they widened, every comparison in here became a silent
 * misordering — a low item reporting `sufficient` (missed reorder) or a full one
 * reporting `low` (false alert). See lib/__tests__/inventory.test.ts.

 * `low_stock_threshold` whether it wants to be or not. Both are `numeric(10,2)`,
 * which Prisma returns as a `Decimal` and `JSON.stringify` renders as a STRING —
 * while every client type declares them `number`. Nothing type-checks across the
 * wire, so the mismatch surfaces only as downstream oddities: `.toFixed()` throwing,
 * or `unitLabel`'s `qty === 1` test failing against `"1"` and printing "1 units".
 *
 * This passed the values through verbatim until 2026-08-05, which was correct while
 * the columns were `Int` and became wrong the moment the fractional-quantity
 * migration widened them. `Number()` is exact here — `numeric(10,2)` tops out at
 * 99999999.99, far inside what a double represents without loss.

// Mixed-unit aggregates

/**
 * How an aggregated quantity is DENOMINATED — the one shape every endpoint that
 * sums `stock_movement.qty` returns alongside its numbers.
 *
 * `stock_movement.unit` is stamped at write time by recordMovements() and frozen,
 * so a ledger that spans a unit change (item edited from `each` to `box`) is now
 * DETECTABLE. It is still not summable: `3 each + 2 box` has no value, and there is
 * no conversion to fall back on — multi-UOM conversion was declined deliberately
 * (D4), because inventing a factor here would rebuild the silent wrongness that
 * stamping the unit exists to end.
 *
 * So aggregates FLAG rather than fail. When `mixed` is true the endpoint returns
 * `null` for every quantity (and for anything derived from one — value, weighted
 * average cost, usage rate, runway) and lets the UI say why. Three rules make that
 * honest rather than merely quiet:
 *
 *  1. The basis is derived ONLY from the stamped units of the rows that actually
 *     fed the aggregate. Never from `inventory_item.unit` — the item's current unit
 *     is exactly the wrong answer, since it is what silently reinterpreted history
 *     before the column existed.
 *  2. The basis covers every row the aggregate touched, including rows outside a
 *     display window that were folded into an opening balance or a running average.
 *     A window that looks internally consistent is still contaminated if its
 *     starting level was summed across the seam.
 *  3. Nothing is truncated to "just the current unit". Dropping the older
 *     denomination would produce a plausible number that quietly disagrees with the
 *     ledger — worse than no number.
 *
 * `units` is SORTED, not chronological: it comes from `array_agg(DISTINCT …)`, which
 * has no cheap chronological form. Copy must therefore say "spans 2 units (box,
 * each)" and never imply a direction ("each → box") the basis cannot support.

 * a distinct unit — a blank is missing information, and treating it as a second
 * denomination would flag a clean series.
 *
 * Each stamp is normalised through the unit catalog before de-duplication:
 * `inventory_item.unit` was freetext before the catalog existed, and the
 * 20260805 migration backfilled `stock_movement.unit` verbatim, so a ledger can
 * legitimately carry "Each" beside "each", or "gallon" beside "gal". Those are the
