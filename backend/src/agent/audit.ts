/**
 * Audit trail for agent activity.
 *
 * Two destinations, on purpose:
 *
 *   · The `log` table (via `logActivity`) records mutations only. It is the
 *     product's audit trail and the source of the activity feed — writing a row
 *     for every read would bury real events under thousands of lookups and make
 *     the feed useless.
 *
 *   · The pino stream records every call, read or write. Volume is fine there,
 *     and "what did the agent look at before it did that" is exactly the
 *     question an incident review asks.
 *
 * Agent rows use `actor_type: "agent"` with `actor_id` set to the HUMAN the
 * agent acted for. That pairing is what lets `getActorHistory` surface agent
 * activity under the person responsible for it, while still allowing a query
 * for "everything any agent did" that a human-actor row would not match.
