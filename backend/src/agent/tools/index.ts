/**
 * Importing this module registers every tool.
 *
 * The registry is populated as a side effect of import, so anything that wants
 * a complete catalog — the MCP server, the assistant loop, a test — imports
 * `agent/index.ts`, which imports this. Adding a tool means adding a line here;
 * forgetting to means the tool silently does not exist, which is why the
 * catalog test asserts the expected names.
