/**
 * `run_report` — one tool over the whole report catalog.
 *
 * `lib/reports/reportRegistry.ts` already defines 17 reports with their loaders
 * and summary logic, all of them org-scoped. Exposing them through a single
 * keyed tool gets the agent every report for the context cost of one tool
 * description, and means a report added to the registry is available to the
 * agent without touching this file.
 *
 * Row output is capped hard. Several of these return every job or line item in
 * a date range, which is a fine payload for an XLSX export and a terrible one
 * for a context window — so the summary is always returned in full and the rows
 * are a sample, clearly labelled as one.
