/**
 * Every dispute, refund, reject and cancel test in this changeset calls the
 * service or the controller directly, so the routers themselves — and the
 * permission gate attached to each route — were never exercised. A transposed
 * string (`edit_quotes` on the invoice refund route) or a `requirePermission`
 * dropped during a refactor would ship green.
 *
 * requirePermission is a factory, so the permission it closes over is not
 * readable from the mounted handler. Mocking the factory to tag the middleware
 * it returns makes the string assertable per route, which is the actual claim:
 * these routes are gated, and gated on the right permission.
