// ============================================================================
// Built-in default email templates — one per followup category.
//
// These are the "starter" HTML templates. An org can override any of them via
// the in-app editor (persisted to the email_template table); a category with no
// saved row falls back to the default here. Templates are rendered with
// templateRenderer.ts, then sent via Postmark HtmlBody.
//
// Available variables (the send-time template model):
//   {{brand.name}} {{brand.logo_url}} {{brand.color}}
//   {{brand.address}} {{brand.phone}} {{brand.website}}
//   {{client_name}}
// Sections like {{#brand.logo_url}}…{{/brand.logo_url}} conditionally render a
// block only when the value is present.
